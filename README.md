Well that was "interesting"! Learned that I can change the width and height in an svg using viewBox which I did for the twitter logo. But for the background images which is how I styled the "dreaded" mobile curvy bits, I had to use background-size to change them from 375px in width to 1000 for my first media query.

And - HEY - Frontend Mentor - I caught your typo - receive, not recieve - I always remember the saying: "I before E, except after C". Typos always jump out at me - except my own, of course :O. But I still love you FEM. I have learned so much from doing your challenges. Thank you so much!

Overall I am happy with the result - of course I could sit and tweek it "until the cows come home" BUT this was my LAST JUNIOR CHALLENGE and I cannot wait to sink my teeth into the juicy Intermediate Challenges :)
